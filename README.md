# Nerve-Image-Segmentation
This project demonstrates the use of the U-Net convolutional architecture for ultrasound nerve segmentation. The dataset contains 5635 training image data of 42 patients with their corresponding masks and 5508 test images from 5 patients whose masks are supposed be predicted. The data is sourced from the Kaggle. The test dataset would be used to detect the presence of Brachial Plexus nerve in the images in an automated manner and the model is trained to detect brachial plexus by classifying and locating the segment with brachial plexus in neck using deep learning and achieved the dice coefficient of 0.51.
